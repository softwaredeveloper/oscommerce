Welcome to osCommerce Online Merchant!

osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 is built on a new framework still in active
development to start building onto with the community. v3.0 does not yet
contain a full user feature set to be able to run an online store on. Now that
the framework is stable, the missing features will be worked on and pushed
through the new CoreUpdate delivery mechanism that can easily upgrade running
installations.

Code submissions (including bug fixes) are subject to the following Contributor
License Agreement (CLA):

We look forward to working with you in improving and extending osCommerce
Online Merchant!

To install osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0, copy the contents of the release
package to your public html directory. The "osCommerce" directory can be added
to the PHP include directory and be moved outside of the public html directory.

The Setup Site will first load to setup and configure a new installation. Once
installed and configured, the Shop and Admin Sites can be reached with:

http://demo.oscommerce.com/index.php (for Shop)
http://demo.oscommerce.com/index.php?Admin (for Admin)

Please note that the Setup Site is still reachable but is locked down. To
unlock the Setup Site, remove the following from
osCommerce/OM/Config/settings.ini:

[Setup]
offline = "true"

For customizations [http://www.phpfreelanceprogrammer.com/oscommerce-programming.html], please copy the file with the same directory structure to
the custom namespace located at:

osCommerce/OM/Custom

The Custom directory can mimick the Core directory to override core files with
customizations.
